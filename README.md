Applied Linear Models Final Project-"Evaluating the factors affecting the mean ozone levels (in parts per billion) using a multiple linear regression model"

BIOST 6202:(FINAL PROJECT USING “Air Data”)
Author: Tiffany M. Kollah 

DESCRIPTION OF "AIR DATA SET": "The Air data set provides daily readings of the following air quality values for May 1, 1973 (a Tuesday) to September 30, 1973."


QUESTION WE ARE SOLVING USING "MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL":
*"Evaluate the factors affecting the mean ozone levels (in parts per billion)"*
*What factors are affecting the mean ozone levels (IN PARTS PER BILLION)???*


**VARIABLES THAT CAN AFFECT THE MEAN OZONE LEVEL:**
(1)• Solar.R: Solar radiation in Langleys in the frequency band 4000–7700 Angstroms from 0800 to 1200 hours at Central Park 

(2)• Wind: Average wind speed in miles per hour at 0700 and 1000 hours at La Guardia Airport 

(3)• Temp: (oF) Maximum daily temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at La Guardia Airport 

(4)•	Month: 5=May, ..., 9=September
